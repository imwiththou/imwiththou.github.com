Vagus
===

[Vagus](http://biestephen.com) is a branch of the [Oculus project](http://www.oculus.im), which aims to provide open biological resources with interdisciplinary subjects such as computational biology and statistical biology. 

[Vagus CN](http://cn.oculus.im) is the site for users to visit within mainland China, as the Great Wall Firewall automatically screen the CSS code for original [Vagus](http://biestephen.com) site in English.

There are several branches for Oculus project, Vagus is one of them. Besides few branches are on the way, one site for casual blogging is [Vagus Blog](http://blog.oculus.im). Currently my interest remains on computational human neural networking simulation(CHNNS) and information evolution in nature. I had created a repo on CHNNS with R and those interested can visit [here](https://github.com/stephenbernie/R), the content might be beginner-lever but surely it will grow.

Any suggestion or idea about the site is warmly welcomed, you may put up your issue here and I will try my best to resolve them ASAP. Furthermore you may send me email requesting for more information or discussion at [here](mailto: imwiththou@gmail.com).
