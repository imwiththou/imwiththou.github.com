Vagus

***

A totally redesigned Vagus site is not alive at <a href="http://beta.biestephen.com/">here</a>. The site is still in beta mode. After all bugs being cleared away the URL will be updated to http://biestephen.com/ instead.


### What is Vagus?

<quote>
  **Vagus**
  
  (/ˈveɪɡəs/ vay-gəs)
  
  Also known as pneumogastric nerve, is one of the 12 cranial nerves.

Vagus can be interpreted as "walking without goals, wondering" as well.

### Why creating this site?

The intention to creat this Vagus site is based on personal portofolio purpose, however, I try to combine everything, including my photography works, graphic designings, academic notes and some other interesting stuff together into it. Now at this stage it is only a practice for CSS/HTML skils (perhaps PHP coding skills in the future).

### Can I use the layout and the designs of the sites?

Yes of course, the site is static and it is open-sourced----everyone is welcomed to use it for personal purposes. However for the photographys and designing works on the site, you might better inform me or put some acknowledgement before using it for other purposes.

### How do I contact you?

You can drop me an Email at <a href="mailto:i@oculus.im">i@oculus.im</a>
