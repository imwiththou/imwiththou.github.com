When you realise that final examination is approaching and you can hardly find out what is missed out for the tests, you are in trouble.

Study room is a good choice but I would rather staying at room with my guitar. When I was tired of studying I might want to play for a while and get back to study again.

My roommate is such a studyholic that got up at six in the morning to study for a whole day without a meal, before that he watched TV dramas for a whole day, though.

I was just wondering what is the point of having such huge pressure under the finals. The essence of education is to cultivate students with learning abilities, not just passing exams. If you study for exams only, that's ridiculous, especially in university education system. Now I started to doubt whether it is time to adjust my attitude toward studying. What is study all for in the future?

Just a bit of thought.
