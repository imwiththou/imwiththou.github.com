A little less conversation, a little more action, please<br /><br />
All this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me<br />
A little more bite and a little less bark<br />
A little less fight and a little more spark<br />
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me<br />
Satisfy me baby

Baby close your eyes and listen to the music<br />
Dig to the summer breeze<br />
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it<br />
Now come along with me and put your mind at ease

Hey! A little less conversation, a little more action, please<br />
All this aggravation ain't satisfactionin' me<br />
A little more bite, a little less bark<br />
A little less fight and a little more spark<br />
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me<br />
Satisfy me baby
