# HEY!!!!!

Wardrobe is where I keep all the themes <del>clothes</del> I coded <del>bought</del>.

## Facts

Stuff about Wardrobe.

### Jekyll features

#### Code highlighting

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

#### Categories

Categories appear under the title of each post on post page, and the category index, if you don't want to use it, just don't assign a category to posts.


## To-Dos

1. Pagination
2. Syntax highlighting code for each theme
3. Style titles
4. Pretty date
5. Instruction
6. RSS feed
7. Category links
8. Signoff
9. Move things out of includes
10. Style blockquotes
11. Check image and iframe presentations in posts

## And...

Why am I doing this?
