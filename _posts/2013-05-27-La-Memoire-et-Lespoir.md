la mémoire et l'espoir
===

---

I sat on the floor of my room, staring at the packed brown paper boxes and travel suitcase, suddenly realised that the year in this room had past, my days living in Hall of Residence 9, had ended.

Time flies so quick. 

Last night I picked up my guitar and played for quite a while before I really went to bed. I played some improvisation that remind me of the past days in my high school. Yesterday when I was having Japanese buffet with one of my junior friends, we talked about the intimate love happened with that time, obvious I did not have but he did, so his recall made me think of something, is there really something out of love?

Now I think the answer might be a bit clearer, it has been one year, or nearly one year that I lived in this room, now it is time to say goodbye. Just like the time we spent in high school, there will definitely be a moment to say farewell to the past memory, man are sure to be grown up, history cannot be rewritten, nor it can be addressed with an 'if'. 

Packing all the luggage took me two days and a night, tomorrow morning, before the sun rises, I shall go and leave this tiny room and leave this island for at least three months. Since the moment I firstly came to Singapore it has been two year and a half, on this island with summer everyday, I experienced lots.

That might be the farewell message, next term I will move into another new room and facing another roommate, Paul (as far as I know), we contacted each other before but I am not totally sure whether he will be my roommate. Life is keeping changing from time to time, yes there is nothing called eternity, except for memory and hope.

Oui, la mémoire et l'espoir.
